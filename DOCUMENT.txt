Hi Elyse - I just spoke with Ramesh Rao (associate dean).  He has not yet
made the Excellence Fund awards, which are also part of the Enron endowment.
He would like to have the dinner in the fall, when all of the awardees have
been chosen.  He felt that a dinner the end of April would conflict with a
major E-commerce conference we're having here, and the Enron awards would
get the attention they deserve in the fall.  The other advantage of a fall
dinner is that the new students will be here, and if we have a big
announcement then, they can see what they have to look forward to.  Will
this work for you?  Thanks.  Sue

Sue:  Thanks for your email.  In speaking with Rick Causey, the only day
that he is available is Monday, April 24.  In speaking with Sally Beck, I
know that you are confirming the 3 winners and will get me their info once
they have been chosen.  If you don't mind seeing who from the university is
available on the 24th, that would be great.  Our other option is to have it
another evening that week or rescheduling for the fall after classes begin.
</BODY>
<BODY>
Thanks, Sally, for the update.  The only day that Rick is available is 
Monday, April 24 - this definitely limits us! I've asked Sharron to find out 
if others can't make it on the 24th (the recipients, Dean May, interviewers), 
would he rather have it on another day that week without him or have it in 
the fall once school starts again. Sharron will let me know what Rick says 
today.  Then, I'll call Sue White to start getting the ball rolling with 
schedules on campus.  I've tentatively booked Jeffrey's private room again 
for the 24th.

Do you want me to notify the winners?  I'm happy to do so.

Elyse

   
	
	

We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene 
Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this 
morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based 
on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today 
with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via 
voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule 
would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow 
morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not 
anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.  
However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients 
until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to 
confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses 
for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official 
notification from the University takes place.  

Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin 
if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the 
dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick 
Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he 
may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she 
would like to be included if her schedule permits.  

Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me 
know how I can help with these arrangements.

Hi Pegah,

I noticed that your files are still not protected as you haven't completed a full backup of your computer.

MyPC Backup software has performed a partial back up of your computer but ran out of storage space on your account, so you still have a large number of files which are not protected.

Today I'm giving 100 users a 70% Discount to ensure you protect the rest of your files. Here is your unique link Pegah;

http://url.mypcbackup.com/syiFpEcs

Use the link above to add more space to your account, this will activate MyPC Backup to automatically complete a full backup and protect the rest of your files.

You have until midnight Friday to claim this exclusive offer.

I must also warn you that it's now been a long time since you received your free MyPC Backup trial. This means we can now delete any files you have already backed up unless you upgrade. As your personal account manager I have prevented this from happening until now, as I still believe you might want to complete your backup in the near future. Remember if your files are deleted you won’t be able to restore them in the event of a computer crash or if accidentally deleted.

Let me know if you have any problems.

Best Regards,

Jamie Heathorn
Personal Account Manager

Sue:  Greetings!  We have not spoken in awhile, but I wanted to touch base 
with you regarding the MBA Excellence Awards and specifically hosting a 
dinner similar to last year's event at Jeffrey's.  I am expecting a baby in 
two weeks, so I'd like to get as much of this planned now as possible!  Amy 
Lee, Charla Stuart and Ali Saler who work in my group will pick up any of the 
pieces that I don't get to prior to becoming a mom, and one of them will 
attend the dinner in Austin.

I have a number of questions:  First, have the award winners been chosen?  
notified? What are their names/phone numbers? Can you help us with the guest 
list from the university?  How does the week of April 24 look on the 
university's calendar?  If we can't find a date before the school year ends, 
we could have the dinner during the beginning of the fall semester, but I'd 
like to try for the end of April/beginning of May.

I would like to use the Josephine House at Jeffrey's Restaurant again - it 
worked well last year, but I haven't called them yet - waiting to hear 
answers to the questions above...

Have a great day!  I can be reached by email or phone at 713-853-0565.

Thanks!
Elyse Kalmans

I have asked Patti to get us together  to discuss your e:mail message as soon 
as possible.  Hopefully, we can work that out this week.  I llok forward to 
talking with you and I will be glad to help you in any way that I can.  

Energy Operations will enjoy participating in this program.  I would like to 
bring this us up at my staff meeting on Monday, April 10, so I will get back 
to you with the number of students and the contact person(s) next week.

</BODY>
<BODY>
We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene 
Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this 
morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based 
on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today 
with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via 
voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule 
would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow 
morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not 
anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.  
However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients 
until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to 
confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses 
for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official 
notification from the University takes place.  

Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin 
if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the 
dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick 
Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he 
may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she 
would like to be included if her schedule permits.  

Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me 
know how I can help with these arrangements.

Sue:  Greetings!  We have not spoken in awhile, but I wanted to touch base 
with you regarding the MBA Excellence Awards and specifically hosting a 
dinner similar to last year's event at Jeffrey's.  I am expecting a baby in 
two weeks, so I'd like to get as much of this planned now as possible!  Amy 
Lee, Charla Stuart and Ali Saler who work in my group will pick up any of the 
pieces that I don't get to prior to becoming a mom, and one of them will 
attend the dinner in Austin.

I have a number of questions:  First, have the award winners been chosen?  
notified? What are their names/phone numbers? Can you help us with the guest 
list from the university?  How does the week of April 24 look on the 
university's calendar?  If we can't find a date before the school year ends, 
we could have the dinner during the beginning of the fall semester, but I'd 
like to try for the end of April/beginning of May.

I would like to use the Josephine House at Jeffrey's Restaurant again - it 
worked well last year, but I haven't called them yet - waiting to hear 
answers to the questions above...

Have a great day!  I can be reached by email or phone at 713-853-0565.

Thanks!

I will be in Houston next week and was wondering if you could spare me some 
time to talk about the back office for Australia. I am the CFO in Sydney and 
am currently running the settlements work done down here and I would also 
like to go over the results of the audit. 

At the moment I have time available both on Wed and Thursday and would 
appreciate it if we could meet up on either of those days if you are 
available. (AC Romero in Cassandra Schultz's office is co-ordinating my 
schedule). Carol Howes and I are meeting with Harry Bucalo on tuesday to look 
at weather settlements issues so we can also address the related control 
issues for this new product if that is convenient. 

Thanks

I just wanted to say thanks for the Astros tickets.  My wife and I enjoyed 
seeing the ballpark and watching the game.  I am really enjoying my work here 
at Enron and am excited about the challenges ahead.  When someone asks me if 
I think I made the right decision to come to Enron, I say yes without 
hesitation.  Thanks again for the tickets, as well as all your support.

Meant to copy you on this reply to Mike, but forgot to do so before my 
initial send.  Here it is...

I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be 
held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be 
held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary 
due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed 
in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)

The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM 
and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior 
Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review 
meetings mirror the "preferred distribution", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in 
Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would 
make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.

Sorry, I can;t help you on this one.  I don't have a copy.  --Sally 

I will be at the meeting on Thursday.  I have asked Brenda Herod to attend as 
well.  Can you add her to your distribution list so that she receives notice 
of these meetings as well?  That way, one or both of us will be able to 
attend.  Thanks.

Definitely take off and meet Scott at the airport.  I know that you will be 
glad to see him.  

   

Sally,

If you don't mind, I'd like to leave early today (2 or 3 pm) to pick up Scott 
(my son) at the airport.  He went to Denver to visit his sister for spring 
break & was scheduled to come back Monday evening.  Unfortunately, due to 
winter storm, all flights were cancelled Monday & most of Tuesday.  I wasn't 
able to get him a flight back until this morning.  Scott, however, was not 
too disappointed in missing 3 days of school (instead of 1 that we planned).  
Anyway, if it's okay with you, I will let your direct reports know that Irena 
will have numbers where they can reach you.

Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday 
morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They 
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.
